A skin is a folder with a number of images inside.
All images have a base, and some modifiers.
to make a filename we do
<base>-<modifier1>-<modifier2, etc>.<type>
type can be png or svg. You can mix the two in a single skin. 64px by 64px is the default size.

The existing bases are:
	box
	playerBottom (The treads of the player)
	playerTop (The rest of the player)
	bullet

the modifiers are, in the order you should add them in:
	blue or orange (for teams, only players should have teams right now)
	dmg1 or dmg2 or dmg3 (This means "damaged". the larger the numbers the more damage)
	frameX (for animations. the first frame(0th) has no modifier.)

so to have a moderately damaged orange player, the name of the file would be:
	player-orange-dmg2.png

If an image is requested but not found, either the base of the image, or if that does not exist, the default box will be used instead.
If you go outside the boundaries of an svg image, the stuff outside the boundaries will be displayed, but will not affect collision detection.
