All images have a base, and some modifiers.
to make a filename we do
<base>-<modifier1>-<modifier2, etc>.png
the .png ending is hardcoded right now, although we can support svgs too
The existing bases are:
player
bullet
box
the existing modifiers are, in the order you should add them in. none is always an option:
dmg1 or dmg2 or dmg3 (This means "damaged". the larger the numbers the more damage)
blue or orange (for teams, only players should have teams right now)
