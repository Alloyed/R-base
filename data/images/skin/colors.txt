# This is the default colors.txt
# The format is name:color, no whitespace allowed.
# A single number between 0-255 is grayscale where each RGB value is that number.
# numbers starting with a # are hex, RGB format, with an optional A byte at the end.
# You can get the value of color defined earlier in the file by using $name
# If you do not supply a color the game expects to exist, 
#  it will spit out a warning and use black instead.
# Note how the names follow the same attribute system as the images.
# That might be meaningful later, if I get around to it.
