Roboticals
--Kyle's thoughts--
TODO(from easy to hard):
	configurable keybindings,
	built-in console/chat setup,
	Clean switch from P2D to opengl/Slick2D

Scales: Box2d works in meters/kilograms/seconds, 
	in the window, 64 px = 1 m right now. a robot is 1 m long/wide.
	All the physical constants are scattered around, have fun finding them
	

--Jon's Thoughts--
TODO: Yay! Basically everything is working. It's just a matter of setting up the event
	sending from the server to the client and having both sides interpolate motion
	in case of hangs.
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
        Possible timeout from client could kill the network. (I guess UDP helps here).
        Um...a lot of other things we haven't seen yet.



--Packaging/running notes--
	To change the svg files, change them in skin-inkscape/, then run convert.sh in skin/
	
	if eclipse complains that it can't find controlP5.xml or uni05_53.ttf, go to: 
	run->run configurations->the run config for the client->arguments->working directory
	and set it to: ${workspace_loc:R-base}
	
	Export using ANT, not eclipses built-in thing.

--For the networking--
