Roboticals
--Kyle's thoughts--
TODO: access settings in UI, change keybindings, make functions to draw individual bodies, 

PROBABLE PROBLEMS: No built-in "window" in gui, cannot control mouse acceleration

Scales: Box2d works in meters/kilograms/seconds, in the window, 64 px = 1 m right now. a robot is 1 m long/wide.
