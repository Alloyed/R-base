Roboticals
--Kyle's thoughts--
TODO: 
	configurable keybindings,
	HUD/non-menu UI,
	built-in console/chat setup,
	Clean switch from P2D to opengl,
	physics

Scales: Box2d works in meters/kilograms/seconds, 
	in the window, 64 px = 1 m right now. a robot is 1 m long/wide. LOL NVM
	

--Jon's Thoughts--
TODO: Yay! Basically everything is working. It's just a matter of setting up the event
	sending from the server to the client and having both sides interpolate motion
	in case of hangs.
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
        Possible timeout from client could kill the network. (I guess UDP helps here).
        Um...a lot of other things we haven't seen yet.



--Eclipse-is-a-piece-of-shit notes--
	if eclipse complains that it can't find controlP5.xml, go to: 
	run->run configurations->the run config for the client->arguments->working directory
	and set it to: ${workspace_loc:R-base}
	
	if a source file gives errors claiming that other classes outside its package cannot be found, go to:
	right click on file->build path->exclude from build path
	and then do that again, this time including to build path
