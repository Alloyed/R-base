TODO: configurable keybindings, 
	make functions to draw individual bodies, 
	measure relative to screen instead of pixels 

PROBABLE PROBLEMS: No built-in "window" in gui, 
					cannot control mouse acceleration, 
					cannot change cursor in fullscreen mode
					
Renderers:Java2d's framerate gets worse as you increase the screen size
		Processing2D works fine, but if you try to draw screen sized rectangles, it gets slower than java2d. 
			If our game has too much happening at once this might be a problem.
		Opengl just crashes on my machine(lol, ATI). I'll leave the files there just in case, though.

Scales: Box2d works in meters/kilograms/seconds, 
	in the window, 64 px = 1 m right now. a robot is 1 m long/wide.
