TODO: make functions to draw individual bodies, 
	configurable keybindings,
	HUD/non-menu UI,
	built-in console/chat setup,
	Try opengl on a platform with good drivers,
	Try rendering textured backgrounds

PROBABLE PROBLEMS: No built-in "window" in gui, 
					cannot control mouse acceleration, 
					cannot change cursor in fullscreen mode
					
Renderers:Java2d's framerate gets worse as you increase the screen size
		Processing2D works fine, but if you try to draw screen sized rectangles, it gets slower than java2d. 
			If our game has too much happening at once this might be a problem.
		Opengl just crashes on my machine(lol, ATI). I'll leave the files there just in case, though.

Scales: Box2d works in meters/kilograms/seconds, 
	in the window, 64 px = 1 m right now. a robot is 1 m long/wide. LOL NVM
	

--Jon's Thoughts--
TODO: Yay! Basically everything is working. It's just a matter of setting up the event
	sending from the server to the client and having both sides interpolate motion
	in case of hangs.

--Eclipse-is-a-piece-of-shit notes--
	if eclipse complains that it can't find controlP5.xml, go to: 
	run->run configurations->the run config for the client->arguments->working directory
	and set it to: ${workspace_loc:R-base}
	
	if a source file gives errors claiming that other classes outside its package cannot be found, go to:
	right click on file->build path->exclude from build path
	and then do that again, this time including to build path 
=======
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
	Possible timeout from client could kill the network. (I guess UDP helps here).
	Um...a lot of other things we haven't seen yet.
