TODO: make functions to draw individual bodies, 
	configurable keybindings,
	HUD/non-menu UI,
	built-in console/chat setup,
	Try opengl on a platform with good drivers,
	Try rendering textured backgrounds

PROBABLE PROBLEMS: No built-in "window" in gui, 
					cannot control mouse acceleration, 
					cannot change cursor in fullscreen mode
					
Renderers:Java2d's framerate gets worse as you increase the screen size
		Processing2D works fine, but if you try to draw screen sized rectangles, it gets slower than java2d. 
			If our game has too much happening at once this might be a problem.
		Opengl just crashes on my machine(lol, ATI). I'll leave the files there just in case, though.

Scales: Box2d works in meters/kilograms/seconds, 
	in the window, 64 px = 1 m right now. a robot is 1 m long/wide.
	

--Jon's Thoughts--
TODO: Yay! Basically everything is working. It's just a matter of setting up the event
	sending from the server to the client and having both sides interpolate motion
	in case of hangs.

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
	Possible timeout from client could kill the network. (I guess UDP helps here).
	Um...a lot of other things we haven't seen yet.
